This game has been developed for the Ludum Dare 41 - 3 days in total. The team was just made up of two people, a programmer and me. 
We started out by spending half a day on choosing the concept, brainstorming idea and discussing about how the game could have been evolved from a basic prototype. We subsequently planned out the development: core features were prioritised during development, while secondary features have been added using the excess time near the end of the jam. Unfortunately, we could not get music and sound effects into the game in the end. 

Among all the concepts we agreed on this half fighting, half cooking pixel art game. The choice of pixel art has been made as it is the quickest kind of visual aesthetic one can achieve and since there were only two of us, that decision was correct in the end. Altough my university courses interfered with the development, all features made into the game and it was completed and released on time.

I just regretted not being able to include sound effects, as mentioned above. The fact that this jam took place during the exam week did not allowed me to find a composer for this project. The final result was exactly as imagined: a funny, simple, fighting minigame.
