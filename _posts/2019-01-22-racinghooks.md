This project was part of the coursework of the module "Gameplay Prototyping" which required to create a 5 minutes-long video as a post-mortem of a playable game prototype made in Unity3D. The concept behind this game is about a racing game in which contestants run by using a grappling hook. The first runner that gets to the finish line ends the game, but the winner is the one who managed to hold an Artefact for the longest amount of time. The Artefact may be stolen by an AI-controlled opponent and can be stolen back by the player.
