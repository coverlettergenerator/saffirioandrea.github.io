This concept has been developed for the Abertay Serious Game Jam 5. The theme of the jam was developing and presenting a concept regarding environmental impact of human activities. 4 student colleagues and I decided to design a management game in which quality of the environment could be raised through research into renewable energy. The game got to the second place.
