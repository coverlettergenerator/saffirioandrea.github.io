This project was part of the coursework of the module "Spatial Constructs" which required to create a 5 minutes-long video of a game prototype. My work is a narrative experience which feature puzzle solving and painting interaction. Throughout the game, the player can enter inside paintings and explore the world inside them, finding clues and collecting information.
