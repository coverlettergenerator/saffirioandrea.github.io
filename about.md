[//]: #About Description

Creativity, passion and ambition.

I am a game designer currently studying at Abertay University. My work consists in planning, designing and creating video games. 

My development process involves the creation of previsualisation material, typically storyboards and sketches, and prototype builds. Altough I have the required skills for working by myself, I love developing in a team where work and passion are casted into engaging game experiences.
