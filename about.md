[//]: #About Description

I am a game designer currently studying at Abertay University. My work consists in planning, designing and creating virtual worlds and game experiences with creativity, passion and ambition.

My development process involves a good amount of previsualisation material, typically storyboards and sketches, and prototype builds. Altough I have the necessary skills for working by myself, I love developing in a team where work and passion are poured into great productions.
